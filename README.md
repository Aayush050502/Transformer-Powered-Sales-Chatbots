Overview
This project consists of two main parts:

Web Scraping and Data Extraction
Transformer-Based Chatbot Development and Evaluation
The aim is to extract product data from an e-commerce website, store it for analysis, and enhance user interaction with a chatbot built using transformer models.

Part 1: Web Scraping and Data Extraction
Key Features:
Libraries Used:
requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, json, datetime, os, time, re.
Scraper Class:
DrRashelScraper: A Python class designed to scrape product information from the Dr. Rashel website.
Extracts product details such as name, price, SKU, description, categories, images, and specifications.
Collects site metadata, contact details, and social media links.
Data Saving:
Stores scraped data in Google Drive in JSON and CSV formats.
Generates a summary of the scraping session.
How to Use:
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
Mount Google Drive in Google Colab:
python
Copy code
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
Execute the script to scrape the data:
python
Copy code
url = "https://dr.rashel.in/"
scraper = DrRashelScraper(url)
data = scraper.scrape_website()
if data:
    save_to_drive(data, 'dr_rashel_data')
Scraping results include:
Complete data in JSON format.
Product data in CSV format.
Summary of scraping in JSON.
Part 2: Transformer-Based Chatbot Development
Key Features:
Libraries Used:
transformers, pandas, datetime.
LLM-Based Chatbot:
Uses GPT-2 for text generation to simulate chatbot responses.
Event Tracking:
Tracks user events such as product views, messages, and purchases.
Logs user behavior for analysis.
Workflow:
Install the required library:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas transformers
Create product data and event logs for analysis.
Analyze user behavior:
python
Copy code
analyze_user_behavior(df_events)
Generate chatbot responses:
python
Copy code
chatbot_reply = generate_chatbot_response("What products help with acne?")
print(f"Chatbot Response: {chatbot_reply}")
Project Structure
DrRashelScraper: Handles scraping tasks.
save_to_drive: Saves extracted data in JSON/CSV format.
analyze_user_behavior: Tracks user activity and provides insights.
generate_chatbot_response: Simulates chatbot responses for user queries.
Dependencies
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

requests
BeautifulSoup4
pandas
transformers
datetime
json
Use Cases
E-commerce Insights:
Extract and analyze product data.
Understand user behavior through event tracking.
Chatbot Enhancement:
Utilize GPT-2 to respond to user queries effectively.
Future Work
Integrate more advanced transformer models like GPT-3 or custom fine-tuned models.
Improve scraping robustness for dynamic websites using Selenium or Playwright.
Add visualization tools for user behavior analysis.
